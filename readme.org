* TODO Usage
* Limitations
** Tables
Sometimes tables can get a bit unruly and hard to read in markdown. ~MdFormat~
will format your tables so that each column is the same min-width. ~MdFormat~
expects that tables have a pipe at the beginning and end of each row, otherwise
they will not be formatted.

Good:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
| Colour | Favourite  |                           | Colour   | Favourite                    |
|--------|----------------------------|           |----------|------------------------------|
| Red              | yes        |            =>   | Red      | yes                          |
| Blue   | not really                   |         | Blue     | not really                   |

#+END_SRC

Bad:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
| Colour | Favourite  |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Red              | yes        |             => Will not properly format.
| Blue   | not really                   |
#+END_SRC
